This widget is an attractive steampunk Yahoo widget for your desktop. This 
widget is a hole in your screen (burnt by the Martians) that can be moved around 
the desktop and placed where you like. It sits underneath all other widgets and 
other desktop items exposing the inner workings of your broken screen.

If you drop any desktop item (shortcuts, files, documents &c) it will 
automatically place those into the appropriate folder, for example .doc files 
will be moved to the my documents folder. If it fails to recognise a specific 
file type then you can manually add that extension to the list and it will deal 
with them from that point on. It works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, Vista and Mac 
OS/X High Sierra, (not tested on XP but it should work).

You can customise the folders to point to any location you wish, you don't have 
to use the Windows/Mac default folders if you don't want to.

The centre cog wheel will rotate occasionally to let you know the widget is 
operational, CTRL+ mouse scrollwheel will resize the widget.

This widget is really useful! Both developers of this tool have very untidy 
desktops but since this widget has been installed our desktops are utterly tidy. 
It is genuinely useful.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to 
fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it 
will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the 
command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for 
windows.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide. 

This widget was created with the serious coding skills of Harry Whitfield. I 
supplied the graphics, the original code, the concept and idea and steered the 
widget toward its final goal. I also tested the widget, added extra 
functionality and fettled the code for release. Harry built the core 
functionality to my spec. but just did it far better than I would ever have 
done!
